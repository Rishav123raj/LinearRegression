# Linear Regression Project with scikit-learn
# Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of linear regression using the scikit-learn library in Python. Linear regression is a supervised learning 
algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.
